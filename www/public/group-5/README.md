# 🔆For Wednesday (Background)

On Wednesday, each group presents:

1. A page structure for personal presentations. An empty html-page that can work
   as a template is enough.
2. What kind of data that would be useful for you to know about your fellow
   students. **Use the json-file in your data/dev folder** and **present new information**,
   or removal of anything you find inappropiate.
3. Something fun. No one can make a living writing code if they don't enjoy it.
4. Code that you don't understand or can't make work. Personal problems are fine
   if your code is not causing any problems at the moment. Take your time, and
   present both the problem as well as the reason it's worth solving. Each group will
   have at least 30 minutes of the class' time. Everyone doesn't have to present a
   problem, but each group should be able to present an interesting case.

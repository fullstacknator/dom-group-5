# Instruction

## 1. create branch (Updated)
One group member creates a new branch locally from exercise-1
```
    git checkout -b excericise-1/Group-x
```
Update: Since you have your own GitHub organisation, you don't have to go through this step. If it's easier for you to just fork the repo as a group, 

## 2. Create folder under path "/objects/group-x"
copy the file `index.js` from folder `/object`

## 3. open the file .env.example and follow the instructions
Only the file `.env.example` should be added to the repo. `.env` is only for local use.

## 4. Install dependency and test run code
At project root from terminal.
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
When a prompt appears, type `students` and hit enter to see that the example data is loaded. The easiest way to replace it is to add more rows in the same format.

UPDATE: This whole assignment should be solved using *only* files in the folder `/objects/group-x/`
